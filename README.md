This is the Log Analysis project for Udacity's Full Stack web developer nanodegree program.  This project shows how I explored a database of news articles using SQL queries.  The queries sought to gian insight about the data regarding the news articles. 

## setup

to set this up, clone this repositor, which contains the README file and the newsdata.py file. 

## Running the program

Launch Vagrant by running vagrant up from the command line, then log with vagrant ssh.

To load the data, type the command psql -d news -f newsdata.sql in the news database.

Run the Python file to execute the program.
